## Welcome to the Exciting World of Python!

This guide will equip you with the knowledge to **set up Python on your computer** using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the Python extension from the Microsoft Store. VS Code is a popular code editor that provides a user-friendly environment for writing and running Python code.

### 1. Download and Install Visual Studio Code

1. Visit the official VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Click on the "Download" button and choose the installer for your operating system.

3. Click on "Get" to download and install Python.

### 4. Verify Python Installation (Optional)

1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window.
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter.

If Python is installed correctly, you should see the installed Python version displayed in the command prompt.

### 5. Create Your First Python Project

2. Go to "File" > "Open Folder" and select a folder to store your Python projects.
3. Create a new Python file by clicking on "File" > "New File" and saving it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `my_first_script.py`).

### 6. Write Your First Python Code

Open the created Python file and paste the following code:

```python
