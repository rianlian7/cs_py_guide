## Welcome to the Exciting World of Python!

This guide will equip you with the knowledge to **set up Python on Replit**, an online platform that allows you to code, run, and share your Python projects without needing any installations. Buckle up, and get ready to embark on your programming journey!

### 1. Create a Replit Account (Optional)

While not mandatory, creating a Replit account allows you to save your projects and access them from anywhere. Head over to [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/) and click on ![Sign Up](images/sign_up.png) to create a free account.

- You may use your school email account or your own Google email.

### 2. Create a New Python Repl

1. Go to [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/) and click on "+ Create Repl."
2. In the "Template" section, search for "Python" and select it.
3. Click on "Create Repl."

Congratulations! You've just created your first Python environment in Replit.

### 3. Exploring the Interface

**Left Panel:**

* **Files:** This section shows your project files. Initially, you'll see a single file named `main.py`.
* **Dependencies:** This allows you to install additional Python libraries if needed.
* **Console:** This is where you'll see the output of your code and interact with your programs.
* **Shell:** This grants access to the underlying command line for more advanced tasks (not required for basic learning).

**Right Panel:**

* **Code Editor:** This is where you'll write your Python code.

### 4. Write Your First Python Code

Open the `main.py` file in the code editor and paste the following code:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
